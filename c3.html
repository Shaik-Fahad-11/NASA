                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>Ben learns that the town has limited funds available to invest in renewable energy. The town council must decide which renewable energy source to prioritize: solar power, wind power, or hydroelectric power. Each option comes with its own set of benefits and challenges.</p>
                <h4>Question</h4>
                <p>Which renewable energy source should the town invest in first?</p>

                <p>The town’s power plant is struggling to keep up with demand. The mayor suggests building a new coal power plant to meet the town’s immediate needs, but Ben knows this will lead to more pollution in the long run. Alternatively, the town could invest in energy-saving technologies and reduce consumption, but this approach will take time.</p>
