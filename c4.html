                <h1>Factory Emissions</h1>
                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>The factories in Ben’s town are a major source of air pollution, but they are also critical to the local economy. Many townspeople rely on factory jobs to make a living. Some of the factory owners are open to adopting cleaner technology, but it will be expensive, and the changes will take time.</p>
                <h4>Question</h4>
                <p>What should Ben propose to reduce factory emissions?</p>

                <p>Private cars are one of the largest sources of air pollution in the town, but many residents rely on them for commuting. Ben must decide whether to promote public transportation, which will reduce emissions but may be inconvenient for some, or encourage the use of electric vehicles (EVs), which are cleaner but more expensive.</p>
