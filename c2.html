                <h1>Industrial Waste Management</h1>
                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>A local factory is dumping toxic waste into the river, but they provide a significant number of jobs in the town. The factory owner offers a compromise: they will reduce waste by 50% and promise to use better filtration systems, but this will take time and may temporarily reduce employment.</p>
                <h4>Question</h4>
                <p>What is the most responsible action Ben should take to address the factory’s pollution?</p>
