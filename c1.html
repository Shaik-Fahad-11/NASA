        <h1>The Importance of Biodiversity</h1>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>Ben notices that the forests are being cleared to make way for a new factory. While replanting trees seems like an easy solution, he realizes that biodiversity in the forest is more important than just planting random trees. A local logging company offers to help, but they want to plant only one type of fast-growing tree to quickly replace the lost forests.</p>
        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>What is the most sustainable decision Ben should make to restore the forest’s biodiversity?</p>

        <h1>Industrialization vs. Nature</h1>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>The town council is considering a proposal to build more factories, which would bring jobs and economic growth. However, these factories will likely cut down more forests and increase pollution. Ben knows that the town needs jobs, but he also understands that the environment needs to be protected.</p>
